# Tip-Calculator
Basic tip calculator without the tax API 
This will help you get started with a bill splitting and tip calculator using python. 
It takes the amount, asks how many people to split the bill, then will ask a tip percentage and will give the total for each person to pay. 
This is the first project I have created on my own with Pyhton through replit.
If there is anything you see that I could do better, please comment and let me know. Feel free to fork this project. 
This will be updated over time and will add a GUI.
